#You have 4 inputs:

#spoils total - The value of riches plundered (will be int)
#expenses - The percentage of the spoils_total, before captain_tax is taken out, that is taken for expenses and ship repairs (i.e. expenses = 5 means 5 percent of total spoils were used for expenses)
#captain tax - The amount of money you as captain skim off the top before distributing to your crew
#crew - a table of crew members where keys represent their names and values represent the amount of money they took
